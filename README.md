# Decentralized Carbon Credit Verification for Reforestation

A blockchain-based platform for transparent, verifiable carbon credits generated through reforestation initiatives.

## Overview

This decentralized application (dApp) revolutionizes carbon credit verification for reforestation projects by creating a transparent, tamper-proof ecosystem for monitoring tree planting, growth verification, credit issuance, and impact reporting. By leveraging blockchain technology, the platform ensures the integrity of carbon credit markets while accelerating global reforestation efforts to combat climate change.

## Core Smart Contracts

## Carbon Credit Lifecycle

1. **Project Registration**: Documentation of planting location, species, methodology
2. **Initial Verification**: Confirmation of planting and baseline conditions
3. **Growth Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of tree growth and survival
4. **Verification Events**: Periodic assessment of carbon sequestration
5. **Credit Issuance**: Minting of carbon credit tokens based on verified capture
6. **Trading**: Exchange of carbon credits on market platforms
7. **Retirement**: Permanent removal of credits once used for offsetting
8. **Impact Reporting**: Ongoing documentation of environmental benefits

## Benefits
